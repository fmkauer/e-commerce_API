# E-commerce Mock API

A mock e-commerce API built with FastAPI that simulates a simple order management system.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Order management (create, view, cancel)
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)
- Mock product data
- In-memory database for testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:

   On Unix-based systems:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Unix-based systems:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Upgrade pip:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

5. Install Poetry:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

6. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment template file
   # Edit the .env file and replace XXXXXXXXXX with your actual API key

7. Install project dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with test
   ```

## Running the API

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access:
- Swagger UI documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc documentation: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Using Swagger UI Authorization

1. Click on the "Authorize" button (ðŸ”“) at the top right of the Swagger UI page
2. In the login form:
   - Enter any of the mock user credentials (e.g., username: `johndoe`, password: `password123`)
   - Click "Authorize"
3. The system will automatically:
   - Call the login endpoint
   - Include the JWT token in all subsequent API requests
4. You can now test any endpoint directly from the Swagger UI

## Available Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /login` - Authenticate user and get JWT token

### Products
- `GET /products` - Get all available products
- `GET /products/{product_id}` - Get a specific product by ID
- `POST /products` - Create a new product (admin only)
- `DELETE /products/{product_id}` - Delete a specific product (admin only)

### Orders
- `GET /orders` - Get all orders for the current user (admin can see all orders)
- `GET /orders/{order_id}` - Get a specific order by ID
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order for the current user
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/cancel` - Cancel a specific order
- `GET /user_orders` - Get all orders for a specific user (admin only)
- `POST /create_order` - Create an order for a specific user (admin only)

### Chat
- `POST /chat` - Chat interaction endpoint

## Mock Users

The API comes with three pre-configured users:

1. Admin User
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123

2. Regular User 2
   - Username: johndoe
   - Password: password123

3. Regular User 3
   - Username: sarahs
   - Password: userpass456

## Mock Products

The API comes with several products. Here are two examples:

1. Classic White T-Shirt
   - ID: 1
   - Price: $19.99
   - Description: A comfortable cotton t-shirt perfect for everyday wear

2. Wireless Headphones
   - ID: 5
   - Price: $129.99
   - Description: Bluetooth headphones with noise cancellation and 20-hour battery life

## Candidate Solution

The candidate solution should be implemented in the `candidate_solution/` directory following these sequential steps:

### Step 1: FAQ-based RAG Implementation
- Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the provided FAQ markdown file
- The system should:
  - Process and index the FAQ content
  - Match user queries with relevant FAQ sections
  - Generate contextually appropriate responses based on the matched FAQ content
  - Maintain conversation coherence while staying within the FAQ knowledge boundaries

### Step 2: Order and Product Listing
- Implement functionality to:
  - List all orders for the current user
  - Display order details including status, items, and total
  - List available products with their details
  - Include proper error handling for invalid requests
  - Maintain conversation context while switching between orders and products

### Step 3: Order Cancellation
- Implement order cancellation functionality:
  - Verify order ownership and eligibility for cancellation
  - Process cancellation requests
  - Provide confirmation and status updates
  - Handle edge cases (already cancelled orders, non-existent orders)
  - Maintain proper error messaging

### Step 4: Order Creation
- Implement new order creation:
  - Guide users through product selection
  - Handle quantity specifications
  - Process the order creation
  - Provide order confirmation with details
  - Include input validation and error handling

### Implementation Requirements
- Maintain conversation context throughout the interaction
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Follow REST API best practices

### Expected Interaction Flow
1. User query is first matched against FAQ content
2. If the query requires specific actions (listing, cancellation, creation), the appropriate module handles it
3. System maintains context and can handle follow-up questions
4. All interactions should be natural and conversational while being accurate and efficient

## Example Usage

1. First, get a JWT token by logging in:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/login" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
   -d "username=user1&password=user123"
   ```

   This will return a response like:
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
     "token_type": "bearer"
   }
   ```

2. Use the JWT token from the response to create a new order:
   ```bash
   # Replace the JWT_TOKEN with the access_token from the login response
   export JWT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."

   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/orders" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "items": [
       {
         "product_id": 1,
         "quantity": 2
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

3. View all orders using the same JWT token:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/orders" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"
   ```

4. Get details of a specific product:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/products/1" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"
   ```
